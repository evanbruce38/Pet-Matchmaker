# Pet-Matchmaker
This project was created to allow a user to easily search for pictures of a selected dog breed. The user can then go to the pet facts page to find random facts about dogs. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and javascript while utilizing a fetch function to pull random picture of fact objects from a third party API.
