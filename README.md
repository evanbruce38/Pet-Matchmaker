# Find-a-K-9
This project was created to allow a user to easily search for pictures of a selected dog breed. The user can then go to our random dog videos page to see a random and entertaining video of a canine. We also have a machine learning page that allows a user to identify a dog photo and will tell them what breed this is (currently this only includes two breeds but can be expanded further). This project was created using HTML, CSS, and javascript while utilizing a fetch function to pull random picture of fact objects from multiple third party APIs.
